- You can change the highlighted directory to a directory of your choice, or use the default directory.

Template requirements:
- To create your own template, start a new project and save it to KICAD_USER_TEMPLATE_DIR
- In the project file create a new folder called "meta"
    - In the meta folder, you must include a file called "info.html".
    - You may also include an icon, which must be saved and stored in the meta folder as "icon.png" (64x64 resolution recommended).
